                    <li>I'll design websites for any purpose except to promote illegal activity, hateful ideologies, politics,
                    AI, or cryptocurrency. Depending on the purpose of your website, I may request to not be credited.</li>
                    <li>If you already have a website that you want me to update or recreate, I can do that instead of
                    creating a new one.</li>
                    <li>Please share any references or mockups you want the site to emulate, as well as any assets you want
                    me to include. Everything shared with me will be confidential.</li>

                    <li>Periodically, I'll email you with status updates containing images of the site on both desktop and mobile
                    devices, as well as any questions I may have for you. <i>This is your chance to give me feedback!</i></li>
                    <li>The first status update will be sent after about 20 hours' worth of work. From there, status updates will
                    be sent based on what your suggest for the site.</li>

                    <li>Once you're satisfied with the website, you'll have to pay me before I can send you the source code.</li>
                    <li>You'll own the website once you buy it, and you can host it wherever you want. If you need any help with
                    hosting, I can give you any guidance you need.</li>
                    <li>Once your site is hosted, please send me a link to it and I'll put it on my <a href="pastwork.html">Past
                    Work</a> page.</li>
