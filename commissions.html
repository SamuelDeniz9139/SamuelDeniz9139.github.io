                <h3>Before We Start</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>I'll design websites for any purpose except to promote illegal activity, hateful ideologies, politics,
                    AI, or cryptocurrency. Depending on the purpose of your website, I may request to not be credited.</li>
                    <li>If you already have a website that you want me to update or recreate, I can do that instead of
                    creating a brand new one- just send me the code and I'll work from there.</li>
                    <li>Please share any references or mockups you want the site to emulate, as well as any assets you want me
                    to include, such as logos or photos. I will only share assets with third parties if instructed to do so.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Periodically, I'll email you with status updates containing images of the site on both desktop and mobile
                    devices, as well as any questions I may have for you. <i>This is your chance to give me feedback!</i></li>
                    <li>The first status update will be sent after about 20 hours' worth of work. From there, status updates will
                    be sent based on your suggestions. You can make as many suggestions as you'd like!</li>

                <h3>Finishing Up</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Once you're satisfied with the website, we'll work out pricing together. Pricing will be based on the
                    purpose of your site, the number of pages, and the amount of time I put into developing it.</li>
                    <li>You'll own the website once you buy it, and you can host it wherever you want. If you need any help with
                    hosting, I can give you any guidance you need.</li>
                    <li>Once your site is hosted, please send me a link to it and I'll put it on my <a href="pastwork.html">Past
                    Work</a> page.</li>
                </ul>
