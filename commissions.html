                    <ul>
                        <li>I'll design websites for any purpose except to promote illegal activity, hateful ideologies, politics, AI,
                        or cryptocurrency. Depending on the purpose of your website, I may request to not be credited.</li>
                        <li>Currently, all websites commissioned will be made with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. More options may become
                        available in the future, though!</li>
                        <li>Please give me an estimated scope of the website you want me to make in advance, such as the amount of
                        subpages you want, what you want them to be for, and any specific functionalities you want on the site.</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Periodically, I'll email you with status updates containing images of the site on both desktop and mobile
                        devices, as well as any questions I may have for you. <i>This is your chance to give me feedback!</i></li>
                        <li>I'll send you the first status update after about 20 hours' worth of work. From there, status updates will
                        be sent based on what your suggest for the site.</li>
                        <li>If you have any images, videos, or other assets you want me to include on your website, <i>please send them
                        to me.</i> I will not share any assets with third parties, including other commissioners.</li>
                        <li>Feel free to share any site mockups or references with me, too!</li>

                        I'll accept pay through my <a href="https://account.venmo.com/u/SamuelDeniz">Venmo</a> account.</li>
                        <li>Because you'll own the website when I'm done with it, <i>I won't host it or pay to do so.</i> However, I
