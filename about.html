            <p>I'm a web designer, front-end developer, and graphic designer based in Fairport, New York. At RIT,
                I majored in New Media Interactive Development and graduated with a Bachelor's of Science in 2023.
                During my college years, I found that I was best at designing and developing websites, and I have
                continued to refine my skills in both fields ever since.<br>
                I believe that any organization with an online presence should have a functional, accessible, and
                appealing website. Because the Internet makes it easy people to interact with companies, a well-made
                website can give a great first impression. With my skills and desire for the best results possible,
                I can make sure every first impression your website makes is a great one.</p>
