                <p>I'm a web designer, front-end developer, and graphic designer based in western New York. I majored
                    in New Media Interactive Development at RIT and graduated with a Bachelor's of Science in 2023.
                    During my college years, I found that I was best at designing and developing websites, and I have
                    continued to refine my skills in both fields ever since. I believe that any company with an online
                    presence should have a functional, accessible, and appealing website. Because the Internet makes
                    it easy for people to interact with companies, a well-made website can give a great first impression.
                    With my skills and desire for the best results possible, I can make sure every first impression
                    your website makes is a great one.</p><br>
